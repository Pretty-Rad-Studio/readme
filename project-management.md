### Starting a task

When you are ready to pick up a task, pick something from *Ready to Work*. Move it to *In Progress* and assign yourself if not already assigned.


### Finishing a task 

You should be working in a separate branch for that task only. When that task is done, create a pull request in github and make a comment in the task linking to that pull request. Move the task to *Ready to Test*
